                <p id="backstory">Kowalski the penguin was done with zoo life—“Waddling in circles? Great for my cardio,
                    but where’s
                    the ice cream?” he huffed. His escape plans ranged from disguising himself as a giant ice cream cone
                    (“Because clearly, everyone thinks I’m a dessert!”) to building a catapult (“Why not launch myself
                    into the nearest gelato shop?”). Each idea was more ridiculous than the last, and yet, he couldn’t
                    help but dream of trading fish for mint chocolate chip. “If only I had a dollar for every time I
                    thought about ice cream, I’d already be out of here!” he muttered. One day, he swore, he’d break
                    free and become the ice cream king he was born to be!
